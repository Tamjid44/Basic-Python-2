#3.	Declare two variables with numerical values. Use comparison operators to check which number is larger.
#How i would do this program
print('Take two numbers')
num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())
if num1/num2 >1 :
  print("Num1 is bigger")
else: print("Num2 is bigger")

#How they wanted me to do this program
a = 2.5
b = 3.34
print('Declared the both variable')
if a>b:
  print('a is bigger')
else: print('b is bigger')

##Another way
a = 2.5
b = 3.34
if a>b:
  print('a is bigger')
else: print('b is bigger')
